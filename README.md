# WordRepository
Have you ever thought of an incredible pickup line, joke, or roast, but had no one to either deliver it to, or share to?  Our app, WordRepository, aims to change this.

With WordRepository, you can find a community to share these glorious thoughts and inspirations, as soon as you have them.

Using Supabase Auth, WordRepository provides a safe and secure way to share your own ideas.  Users can sign up and log in seamlessly.
Our database is designed using Supabase's database, built on top of POSTGRE.  It organizes pickup lines into different sections and allows you to like, rate, and save lines.

In the future, additional functionality will be added, such as full, complete, search for different pickup lines, and expansion into roasts, jokes, and compliments.
